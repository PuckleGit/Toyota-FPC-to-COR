Original wiring and information about the control and methodoloy can be found here http://wilbo666.pbworks.com/w/page/43601575/Toyota%20FPC%20to%20COR%20Wiring

Schematics have been built using KiCAD 9.0 adding specifc component specifcations into the schematics for clairity and ease of use. 

The design also incorparates the use of a relay interface to fit an ISO Micro relay
