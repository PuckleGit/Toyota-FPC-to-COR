# Toyota Fuel Pump Control to Circuit Opening Relay
Remake of circuit schematics and diagrams of the Fuel Pump Computer to Circuit Opening Relay originally created by wilbo666 for use on Toyota vehicles

Original wiring and information about the control and methodoloy can be found here http://wilbo666.pbworks.com/w/page/43601575/Toyota%20FPC%20to%20COR%20Wiring

Schematics have been built using KiCAD 9.0 adding specifc component specifcations into the schematics for clairity and ease of use. 

The design also incorparates the use of a relay interface to fit an ISO Micro relay in the form of a V23333-Z0002-B049
